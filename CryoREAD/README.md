## News
Apr 2024: CryoREAD includes a new model to support DNA/RNA structure modeling for input maps from 5-10A. The model is trained with maps at resolution 5-10A, and it will be used in CryoREAD once the input resolution is 5-10A.

# Online Platform:

## Server(Recommended): https://em.kiharalab.org/algorithm/CryoREAD
<details>
We have three publicly available platforms, which basically offer the same functionality.
Input: cryo-EM map+sequence file (optional). Output: modeled structure. The input and output are the same across all platforms.
</details>

### Google Colab: https://bit.ly/CryoREAD
<details> 
   
   Step-by-step instructions are available. Limited by redistribution constraints of Coot and Phenix, the structure here is not refined and may include atom clashes. If you want better structure, please use our [server](https://em.kiharalab.org/algorithm/CryoREAD) or Github.  For free user, colab has 4-hour running time limit and may not work for large structure(>=1000 nucleotides).
   
</details>

### Local installation with source code at Github
<details>
Full code is available here and it is easier for user to modify to develop their own tools.
<br>It provides two additional supports:
<br>1. Detection Output: This option outputs probability values of detected phosphate, sugar, base, and base types, computed by deep learning, in the map, for users reference.
<br>2. Refinement pipeline: structures from other source can be refined in the specified EM map.

## Introduction
<details>
   <summary>Cryo_READ is a computational tool using deep learning to automatically build full DNA/RNA atomic structure from cryo-EM map.  </summary>
DNA and RNA play fundamental roles in various cellular processes, where the three-dimensional (3D) structure provides critical information to understand molecular mechanisms of their functions.  Although an increasing number of structures of nucleic acids and their complexes with proteins are determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), structure modeling for DNA and RNA is still often challenging particularly when the map is determined at sub-atomic resolution. Moreover, computational methods are sparse for nucleic acid structure modeling.

Here, we developed a deep learning-based fully automated de novo DNA/RNA atomic structure modeling method, CryoREAD. CryoREAD identifies phosphate, sugar, and base positions in a cryo-EM map using deep learning, which are traced and modeled into a 3D structure. When tested on cryo-EM maps determined at 2.0 to 5.0 Ã… resolution, CryoREAD built substantially accurate models than existing methods. We have further applied the method on cryo-EM maps of biomolecular complexes in SARS-CoV-2.

python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=[Map_Path] -M=[Model_Path] --contour=[half_contour_level] --gpu=[GPU_ID] --batch_size=[batch_size] --resolution=[Map_Resolution] --no_seqinfo --refine
```
[Map_Path] is the path of the experimental cryo-EM map, 
<br>[Model_Path] is the path of our pre-trained deep learning model, (If you want to reproduce the results in our paper, your can specify "best_model_paper". Here the default path is the new model trained on the entire dataset.)
<br>[half_contour_level] is 0.5* contour_level (suggested by author) to remove outside regions to save processing time, 
<br>[GPU_ID] specifies the gpu used for inference,
<br> [batch_size] is the number of examples per batch in the inference (we used 8 with a 24GB GPU), 
<br>[Map_Resolution] is the resolution of the deposited maps.

"--refine" should be removed if you can not successfully install Phenix/coot correctly, which may result in nucleotides that do not satisfy some geometry and chemical constraints.

The automatically build atomic structure is saved in [Predict_Result/(map-name)/CryoREAD_noseq.pdb] (or  [Predict_Result/(map-name)/CryoREAD_norefine.pdb] if you do not add --refine param) in pdb format. You can also add ```--output=[your_directory]``` to specify the output directory. Then the output will be saved in [output_dir/CryoREAD_noseq.pdb]. 

#### Example Command:
```
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=example/21051.mrc -M=best_model --contour=0.3 --gpu=0 --batch_size=4 --resolution=3.7 --no_seqinfo --refine

```
[Map_Path] is the path of the experimental cryo-EM map, 
<br>[Model_Path] is the path of our pre-trained deep learning model, (If you want to reproduce the results in our paper, your can specify "best_model_paper". Here the default path is the new model trained on the entire dataset.)
<br>[Fasta_Path] is the path of the input fasta file about sequence information, 
<br>[half_contour_level] is 0.5* contour_level (suggested by author) to remove outside regions to save processing time, 
<br>[GPU_ID] specifies the gpu used for inference, 
<br>[batch_size] is the number of examples per batch in the inference (we used 8 with a 24GB GPU), 
<br>[rule_soft] specifies the assignment rule, default is 0 to use the strict assignment assembling rule, 
<br>[Map_Resolution] is the resolution of the deposited maps.
<br>[num_thread] specifies the number of CPUs used for fragment-based sequence assignment.

"--refine" should be removed if you can not successfully install Phenix/coot correctly,which may result in nucleotides that do not satisfy some geometry and chemical constraints.



#### Example Command:
```
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=example/21051.mrc -M=best_model -P=example/21051.fasta --contour=0.3 --gpu=0 --batch_size=4 --rule_soft=0 --resolution=3.7  --refine --thread 4 
```
The automatically build atomic structure is saved in [Predict_Result/(map-name)/CryoREAD.pdb] in pdb format (or  [Predict_Result/(map-name)/CryoREAD_norefine.pdb] if you do not add --refine param). Modeled structures without considering sequence information are also saved as [Predict_Result/(map-name)/Output/CryoREAD_noseq.pdb] (without refinement). Meanwhile, structures only considering the sequence information without connecting gap regions are saved in [Predict_Result/(map-name)/Output/CryoREAD_seqonly.pdb] (without refinement) for reference.
<br>Please adjust --thread based on your available CPU numbers (more is better).

The full refinement pipeline involving Phenix and coot is also available for refinement-only purposes. 
```
python3 main.py --mode=1 -F=[input_structure_pdb] -M=[input_map_path] -P=[output_dir] --resolution=[resolution]
```
This refinement pipeline can work for any given structure (not limited to DNA/RNA) and a corresponding map.
<br>[input_structure_pdb] is the path of the input structure in pdb format, 
<br>[input_map_path] corresponds to the input map path. 
<br>[output_dir]: the directory you specify to save the outputs during refinement process. The final output Refine_cycle3.pdb will be generated in this directory.
<br> [resolution] is the resolution of the deposited maps.

#### Example Command:
```
python3 main.py --mode=1 -F=example/6v5b_drna.pdb -M=example/21051.mrc -P=refine_test --resolution=3.7
```
This will refine the input structure according to density and output the refined structure in [refine_test] directory. 

</details>

### Predicted Structure Evaluation
<details>

<summary>Structure Evaluation in CryoREAD (if you only want to compare your predicted structure with native structure)</summary>

We provided the evaluation pipeline used in CryoREAD, use 5Ã… as a cutoff. Different from Phenix, we matched the nucleotides based on the average distance of the backbone atoms of nucleotides instead of only using P atoms, which is not so stable and accurate. 

To use our evaluation pipeline, please use
```
python3 main.py --mode=2 -F=predicted.cif[.pdb] -M=target.cif[.pdb] 
```
Here -F takes the predicted pdb/cif file and -M takes the native pdb/cif files. The example output is as follows
```
****************************************************************************************************
Atom Coverage: 0.940 Atom Precision: 0.872
Sequence Recall(Match): 0.600 Sequence Precision(Match): 0.562
Sequence Recall: 0.564 Sequence Precision: 0.490
RMSD: 3.010
****************************************************************************************************
```
All the reported metrics in our paper can be calculated. 

Atom Coverage is computed as the fraction of sugar atoms (C1â€², C2â€², O2â€² for RNA, C3â€², O3â€², C4â€², O4â€², C5â€²) and phosphate atoms (P, OP1, OP2, O5â€², OP3â€²) that were closer than 5 Ã… to a matched sugar or phosphate node for each nucleotide, which were then averaged over all the nucleotides in the map.
Atom Precision is computed as the fraction of nodes within 5 Ã… to the corresponding atoms of its closest nucleotides. 

A cutoff of 5 Ã… was used because it is shorter than the average distance between adjacent phosphate atoms, which is 6.0 Ã….

Sequence recall is computed by identifying a nucleotide in the model that corresponds to each nucleotide in the reference structure. This identification is done by assigning the nucleotide in the model that has the closest average atom distance to each nucleotide in the reference structure. Then, it is determined whether the bases are identical. Finally, the fraction of identical bases over all the bases in the reference structure is computed.

Sequence recall (match) only considers nucleotides in the reference structure that have a corresponding nucleotide in the model (an average atom pair distance of less than 5 Ã…). 

Sequence precision is defined as the fraction of the identical bases over all the bases in the model.

Sequence precision (match) only considers nucleotides in the model structure that have a corresponding nucleotide in the reference (an average atom pair distance of less than 5 Ã…). 

RMSD is calculated between backbone atoms of nucleotides in the model structure that have a corresponding nucleotide in the reference.

For a comprehensive assessment, it is important to use multiple metrics to evaluate the accuracy of DNA/RNA structure modeling. Each metric provides different aspects of the modeling performance.
